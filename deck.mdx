## How to design a welcoming, accessible website

---

... in 25min?

<Image height="20rem" width="30rem" src="skeptical.jpeg" />

---

What do we mean by <i><strong>Welcoming</strong></i> and <i><strong>Accessible</strong></i>?

---

A site anyone can go to, do what they need and be comfortable doing it.

---

# STORY TIME

Gather 'round!

---

You're planning a huge party!

You want everyone to show up and have a great time.

---

This is no small get together.

This is a massive rager and you might not know everyone that well!

---

#### <i>... the party is your website</i>

---

## 1. Where's the party at?

Location, location, location, ...

---

Choose a location that's <b>quick</b> for most people to reach and <b>easy</b> to find.

Hopefully it's not at the end of a 30km, single lane, dirt road with no signage.

---

### Hosting and domain

- In the cloud near your user base
- Plesk and Managed WordPress in any region.

---

Choose a concise domain that's easy to remember.

<Image height="15rem" width="60rem" src="decapitated.png" />

---

### Performance and design

Do guests need an off-road vehicle to get there?

Is your site responsive and/or mobile first?

---

### Why Mobile first?

Forces you to think of the minimum set of elements, functionality your users need to use your site.

---

### Progressive Enhancement

The gravy that is everything else

(extra videos, imagery, animations, etc...)

---

This applies to older computers and browsers as well.

---

## 2. Where's the bar?

Coat check? Restrooms?

---

Navigation, Information Architecture, A11y

---

Have someone greet the arriving guests with the important stuff

---

If you want people to use the coat check, you don't but it at the back, next to the kitchen.

Put it up front by the doors.

---

### Less is more for your nav.

Hide things in reverse priority.

Consider top-level pages as their own navigation.

---

Use familiar signage. Restrooms, Exit, no-smoking, etc..

Icons, Hamburger, Arrows, etc...

---

### Information Architecture

A fancy way of describing the priority of your content

---

If you want a part of your site to get more traffic, get it front and centre.

Expect to lose people as they scroll!

---

### Accessibility (a11y)

Familliar Elements - Inputs, Radios, checkboxes, buttons, etc...

---

### Semantic HTML

- Accessible by default
- Id's, Headings, Sections
- Screen readers and keyboard users

Cool designs can break things

- Scroll jacking and focus styles

---

## 3. Emcee or MC?

Your content or copy

---

Are they captivating, entertaining, but also speaking clearly?

---

Are they offensive to the crowd?

Singling people out and making fun of them?

This isn't a raunchy comedy show. This is for everyone.

---

Use clear language for important material, add some fun copy after that.

---

Important for SEO.

If you're selling toasters, make sure your site is littered with the word <i>toaster</i>.

---

### Dark Patterns

"25 people in your area are looking at this right now!"

"You don't want to be a chump and miss this deal do you?"

Moving cancel buttons to trick people

---

Pisses people off and erodes trust and your brand.

---

### Inclusion vs Accessibility

The word "easy", cultural sensitivity, LGBT+

---

## 4. Band or DJ?

Colours, fonts and imagery

---

- Is the music too loud?
- Is there something for everyone?
- Is it appropriate to the setting?

---

Colours, fonts and imagery build your brand, can build trust and bring out emotions.

Maybe not use harsh, black and bright neon colours for your spa's website?

---

### More a11y

- Images with alt text
- Contrast ratios - too high or too low
- Animations can cause motion sickness or disorientation

---

## 5. Invitations

Will your guest list even know about this party?

---

Are you relying on word of mouth?

---

Maybe groups of guests might follow each other to get there?

---

Maybe you have this kind of party every year?

Some attendees don't even need the invitation and will just show up.

---

## SEO

(search engine optimization)

Where do you rank in a Google search?

---

Content and Meta Tags

---

<b>Google has changed how they rank sites over time.</b>

---

### Mobile first

Both in responsiveness and Performance.

3G seems to be the bar

---

5s or more = 37% bounce rate

---

70% of customers say page speed affects their purchasing decisions

---

1s costs ~7% conversions

---

### 3 of the 4 top factors for Google rankings are UX

- Time on site
- Pages per session
- Bounce rate

---

### 1st factor

### Direct website visits

Those are your regulars.

---

# Good news

15% of sites load at a reasonable speed

---

## Checklists are fun

1. Site performance and address
2. Navigation and structure
3. Inclusion and Accessibility
4. Aesthetic
5. SEO

---

<b>The aesthetic of your site is but a small part.</b>

---

# Throw it all out the window!

---

Maybe your target market are a bunch of ATV-driving, loud music listening people that know exactly where the party is.

Find out!

---

## Do user research

UserTesting.com, LiveSession.io, HotJar.com, etc...

---

## Track with Analytics

Google Analytics, MixPanel, etc...

---

# Thanks!

@matldupont

---

## Bonus?

---

## The meal

A predefined menu.

---

When your guests stop to think, they're not partying.

That's why they came.

---

Some people are nervous trying new food. Don't put artichokes on all your pizzas.

This might put a stain on their evening.

---

### Customers

When they stop to think, they're not buying what they wanted.

They take a step back and become critical.

---

Don't turn on a person's critical brain

They're there to buy, let them.

---

Popups, Cross-selling and asking for unnecessary information.

---

## Okay, for real... thanks!
